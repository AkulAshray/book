# DF Technical Guide

**By Tech Upskilling Team**

This is the start of a book for Data Science Intensive (DSI) Bootcamp provided as part of Level 4 Data Analyst Apprenticeship at Multiverse. 

DSI prepares you for real world data analysis. In theory, drawing conclusions from data is simple - load a data table, make a plot, and fit a model. In reality however, its not that simple. Data is messy and individual circumstances and business use cases vary, which means thats the work of a data scientist is not just restricited to learning new skills but figuring out how to apply them in different circumstances. This book attempts to address this issue, but providing a collection of tutorials and real life examples in an interactive environment to allow readers to test out their learning.

Here are some of the objectives we cover are essential concepts of:

* **Statistics and Probability**

* **Software and Computing**

* **Machine Learning**

* **Data Science**

* **Apply data science for different contexts**

* **Covers case studies and applications**
