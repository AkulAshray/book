```{admonition} Welcome!
The goal of this website is to teach python programming and machine learning, even without a strong technical background.
```

With this website I aim to provide an introduction to everything you need to know to start using Python for data science. I am hoping it will act as a codebook, where you can execute the code and make notes on the website. Weâ€™ll cover topics such as basic programming, using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data exploration and visualization and topics on Machine Learning.
