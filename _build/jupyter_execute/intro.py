<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#666;background-color:#666;" />

This website is for coaches, with the intended purpose of allowing coaches and associates to learn and work on upskilling their technical skills during independent learning time. You can also search this website if you are only interested to look at specific topic. Since its meant for coaches we take the liberty of going over slightly more advanced concepts which may not be covered with apprentices!!
