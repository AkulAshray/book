# Relational Databases and SQL
<hr style="height:0.6px;border:none;color:#666;background-color:#666;" />

In the previous tutorial, we worked with data stored in CSV files. However, CSV files are inconvenient in many real-world scenarios. Data scientists commonly work on a team to analyze a shared dataset. For instance, an financial analyst group might receive new data on an minute basis. Instead of downloading a new CSV file every minute, data scientists prefer to use shared data storage that always reflects the most up-to-date data. 

**Database systems** are software systems specifically designed for large-scale data storage and retrieval. Industry, academic research, and governments all rely on database systems. One common and useful type of database system is an relational database management system (RDBMS). These systems allow data scientists to use a query language called SQL to quickly retrieve and process large amounts of data at once. In this chapter, we introduce the relational database model and SQL.

## The Relational Model 

A **database** is an organized collection of data. In the past, data was stored in specialized data structures that were designed for specific tasks. For example, airlines might record flight bookings in a different format than a bank managing an account ledger. In 1969, Ted Codd introduced the relational model as a general method of storing data. Data is stored in two-dimensional tables called **relations**, consisting of individual observations in each row (commonly referred to as **tuples**). Each tuple is a structured data item that represents the relationship between certain **attributes** (columns). Each attribute of a relation has a name and data type.

Consider the `purchases` relation below:

<header style="text-align:center"><strong>purchases</strong></header>
<table border="1" class="DataFrame">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td><b>name</b></td>
            <td><b>product</b></td>
            <td><b>retailer</b></td>
            <td><b>date purchased</b></td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Samantha</td>
        <td>iPod</td>
        <td>Best Buy</td>
        <td>June 3, 2016</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Timothy</td>
        <td>Chromebook</td>
        <td>Amazon</td>
        <td>July 8, 2016</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jason</td>
        <td>Surface Pro</td>
        <td>Target</td>
        <td>October 2, 2016</td>
    </tr>
</table>

In `purchases`, each tuple represents the relationship between the `name`, `product`, `retailer`, and `date purchased` attributes. 

A relation's *schema* contains its column names, data types, and constraints. For example, the schema of the `purchases` table states that the columns are `name`, `product`, `retailer`, and `date purchased`; it also states that each column contains text.

The following `prices` relation shows the price of certain gadgets at a few retail stores:

<header style="text-align:center"><strong>prices</strong></header>
<table border="1" class="DataFrame">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td><b>retailer</b></td>
            <td><b>product</b></td>
            <td><b>price</b></td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Best Buy</td>
        <td>Galaxy S9</td>
        <td>719.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Best Buy</td>
        <td>iPod</td>
        <td>200.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Amazon</td>
        <td>iPad</td>
        <td>450.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Amazon</td>
        <td>Battery pack</td>
        <td>24.87</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Amazon</td>
        <td>Chromebook</td>
        <td>249.99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Target</td>
        <td>iPod</td>
        <td>215.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Target</td>
        <td>Surface Pro</td>
        <td>799.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Target</td>
        <td>Google Pixel 2</td>
        <td>659.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Walmart</td>
        <td>Chromebook</td>
        <td>238.79</td>
    </tr>
</table>

We can then reference both tables simultaneously to determine how much Samantha, Timothy, and Jason paid for their respective gadgets (assuming prices at each store stay constant over time). Together, the two tables form a **relational database**, which is a collection of one or more relations.
The schema of the entire database is the set of schemas of the individual relations in the database.

### Relational Database Management Systems

A relational database can be simply described as a set of tables containing rows of individual data entries. A relational database management system (RDBMSs) provides an interface to a relational database. [Oracle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oracle_Database), [MySQL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MySQL), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PostgreSQL) are three of the most commonly used RDBMSs used in practice today.

Relational database management systems give users the ability to add, edit, and remove data from databases. These systems provide several key benefits over using a collection of text files to store data, including:

1. Reliable data storage: RDBMSs protect against data corruption from system failures or crashes.
1. Performance: RDBMSs often store data more efficiently than text files and have well-developed algorithms for querying data.
1. Data management: RDBMSs implement access control, preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive datasets.
1. Data consistency: RDBMSs can impose constraints on the data enteredâ€”for example, that a column `GPA` only contains floats between 0.0 and 4.0.

To work with data stored in a RDBMS, we use the SQL programming language.

### RDBMS vs. pandas

How do RDBMSs and the `pandas` Python package differ? First, `pandas` is not concerned about data storage. Although DataFrames can read and write from multiple data formats, `pandas` does not dictate how the data are actually stored on the underlying computer like a RDBMS does. Second, `pandas` primarily provides methods for manipulating data while RDBMSs handle both data storage and data manipulation, making them more suitable for larger datasets. A typical rule of thumb is to use a RDBMS for datasets larger than several gigabytes. Finally, `pandas` requires knowledge of Python in order to use, whereas RDBMSs require knowledge of SQL.

## SQL

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a programming language that has operations to define, logically organize, manipulate, and perform calculations on data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

SQL is a declarative language. This means that the user only needs to specify *what* kind of data they want, not *how* to obtain it. An example is shown below, with an imperative example for comparison:

- **Declarative**: Compute the table with columns "x" and "y" from table "A" where the values in "y" are greater than 100.00.
- **Imperative**: For each record in table "A", check if the record contains a value of "y" greater than 100. If so, then store the record's "x" and "y" attributes in a new table. Return the new table.

In this tutorial, we will write SQL queries as Python strings, then use `pandas` to execute the SQL query and read the result into a `pandas` DataFrame. As we walk through the basics of SQL syntax, we'll also occasionally show `pandas` equivalents for comparison purposes.

### Executing SQL Queries through `pandas`
<hr>

To execute SQL queries from Python, we will connect to a database using the [sqlalchemy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/tutorial.html) library. Then we can use the `pandas` function [pd.read_sql](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_sql.html) to execute SQL queries through this connection.

import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy

sqlite_uri = "sqlite:///sql_basics.db"
sqlite_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(sqlite_uri)

This database contains one relation: `prices`. To display the relation we run a SQL query. Calling `read_sql` will execute the SQL query on the RDBMS, then return the results in a `pandas` DataFrame.

# pd.read_sql takes in a parameter for a SQLite engine, which we create below

sql_expr = """
SELECT * 
FROM Prices
"""
prices = pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)
prices.head()

### SQL Syntax
<hr>

All SQL queries take the general form below:
```SQL
SELECT [DISTINCT] <column expression list>
FROM <relation>
[WHERE <predicate>]
[GROUP BY <column list>]
[HAVING <predicate>]
[ORDER BY <column list>]
[LIMIT <number>]
```

```{note}

1. **Everything in \[square brackets\] is optional.** A valid SQL query only needs a `SELECT` and a `FROM` statement.
2. **SQL SYNTAX IS GENERALLY WRITTEN IN CAPITAL LETTERS.** Although capitalization isn't required, it is common practice to write SQL syntax in capital letters. It also helps to visually structure your query for others to read.
3. `FROM` query blocks can reference one or more tables, although in this section we will only look at one table at a time for simplicity.
```

## SELECT and FROM

The two mandatory statements in a SQL query are:

* `SELECT` indicates the columns that we want to view.
* `FROM` indicates the tables from which we are selecting these columns.

To display the entire `prices` table, we run:

sql_expr = """
SELECT * 
FROM prices
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine).head()

`SELECT *` returns every column in the original relation. To display only the retailers that are represented in `prices`, we add the `retailer` column to the `SELECT` statement.

sql_expr = """
SELECT retailer
FROM prices
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine).head()

If we want a list of unique retailers, we can call the `DISTINCT` function to omit repeated values.

sql_expr = """
SELECT DISTINCT(retailer)
FROM prices
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine).head()

This would be the functional equivalent of the following `pandas` code:

prices['retailer'].unique()

Each RDBMS comes with its own set of functions that can be applied to attributes in the `SELECT` list, such as comparison operators, mathematical functions and operators, and string functions and operators. Here we use PostgreSQL, a mature RDBMS that comes with hundreds of such functions, the complete list is available [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/functions.html). Keep in mind that each RDBMS has a different set of functions for use in `SELECT`.

The following code converts all retailer names to uppercase and halves the product prices.

sql_expr = """
SELECT
    UPPER(retailer) AS retailer_caps,
    product,
    price / 2 AS half_price
FROM prices
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine).head(10)

```{note}
Notice that we can **alias** the columns (assign another name) with `AS` so that the columns appear with this new name in the output table. This does not modify the names of the columns in the source relation.
```

### WHERE

The `WHERE` clause allows us to specify certain constraints for the returned data; these constraints are often referred to as **predicates**. For example, to retrieve only gadgets that are under $500:

sql_expr = """
SELECT *
FROM prices
WHERE price < 500
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine).head(10)

We can also use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to further constrain our SQL query. To find an item on Amazon without a battery pack under $300, we write:

sql_expr = """
SELECT *
FROM prices
WHERE retailer = 'Amazon'
    AND NOT product = 'Battery pack'
    AND price < 300
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

The equivalent operation in `pandas` is:

prices[(prices['retailer'] == 'Amazon') 
   & ~(prices['product'] == 'Battery pack')
   & (prices['price'] <= 300)]

```{note}
There's a subtle difference that's worth noting: the index of the Chromebook in the SQL query is 0, whereas the corresponding index in the DataFrame is 4. This is because SQL queries always return a new table with indices counting up from 0, whereas `pandas` subsets a portion of the DataFrame `prices` and returns it with the original indices. We can use [pd.DataFrame.reset_index](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.reset_index.html) to reset the indices in `pandas`.
```

### Aggregate Functions

So far, we've only worked with data from the existing rows in the table; that is, all of our returned tables have been some subset of the entries found in the table. But to conduct data analysis, we'll want to compute aggregate values over our data. In SQL, these are called **aggregate functions**. 

If we want to find the average price of all gadgets in the `prices` relation:

sql_expr = """
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM prices
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

Equivalently, in `pandas`:


prices['price'].mean()

A complete list of PostgreSQL aggregate functions can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/functions.html). Though we're using PostgreSQL as our primary version of SQL, keep in mind that there are many other variations of SQL (MySQL, SQLite, etc.) that use different function names and have different functions available.

### GROUP BY and HAVING

With aggregate functions, we can execute more complicated SQL queries. To operate on more granular aggregate data, we can use the following two clauses:
- `GROUP BY` takes a list of columns and groups the table like the [pd.DataFrame.groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) function in `pandas`.
- `HAVING` is functionally similar to `WHERE`, but is used exclusively to apply conditions to aggregated data. (Note that in order to use `HAVING`, it must be preceded by a `GROUP BY` clause.)

**Important**: When using `GROUP BY`, all columns in the `SELECT` clause must be either listed in the `GROUP BY` clause or have an aggregate function applied to them.

We can use these statements to find the maximum price at each retailer.

sql_expr = """
SELECT retailer, MAX(price) as max_price
FROM prices
GROUP BY retailer
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

Let's say we have a client with expensive taste and only want to find retailers that sell gadgets over $700. Note that we must use `HAVING` to define conditions on aggregated columns; we can't use `WHERE` to filter an aggregated column. To compute a list of retailers and accompanying prices that satisfy our needs, we run:

sql_expr = """
SELECT retailer, MAX(price) as max_price
FROM prices
GROUP BY retailer
HAVING max_price > 700
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

For comparison, we recreate the same table in `pandas`:

max_prices = prices.groupby('retailer').max()
max_prices.loc[max_prices['price'] > 700, ['price']]

### ORDER BY and LIMIT

These clauses allow us to control the presentation of the data:
- `ORDER BY` lets us present the data in alphabetical order of column values. By default, ORDER BY uses ascending order (`ASC`) but we can specify descending order using `DESC`.
- `LIMIT` controls how many tuples are displayed.

Let's display the three cheapest items in our `prices` table:

sql_expr = """
SELECT *
FROM prices
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 3
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

Note that we didn't have to include the `ASC` keyword since `ORDER BY` returns data in ascending order by default.
For comparison, in `pandas`:

prices.sort_values('price').head(3)

(Again, we see that the indices are out of order in the `pandas` DataFrame. As before, `pandas` returns a view on our DataFrame `prices`, whereas SQL is displaying a new table each time that we execute a query.)

### Conceptual SQL Evaluation

Clauses in a SQL query are executed in a specific order. Unfortunately, this order differs from the order that the clauses are written in a SQL query. From first executed to last:

1. `FROM`: One or more source tables
2. `WHERE`: Apply selection qualifications (eliminate rows)
3. `GROUP BY`: Form groups and aggregate
4. `HAVING`: Eliminate groups
5. `SELECT`: Select columns

**Note on `WHERE` vs. `HAVING`**: Since the `WHERE` clause is processed before applying `GROUP BY`, the `WHERE` clause cannot make use of aggregated values. To define predicates based on aggregated values, we must use the `HAVING` clause.

## SQL Joins

In `pandas` we used the `pd.merge` method to join two tables using matching values in their columns. For example:

```python
pd.merge(table1, table2, on='common_column')
```

In this section, we introduce SQL joins. SQL joins are used to combine multiple tables in a relational database.

Suppose we are cat store owners with a database for the cats we have in our store. We have **two** different tables: `names` and `colors`. The `names` table contains the columns `cat_id`, a unique number assigned to each cat, and `name`, the name for the cat. The `colors` table contains the columns `cat_id` and `color`, the color of each cat.

```{note}
Note that there are some missing rows from both tables - a row with `cat_id` 3 is missing from the `names` table, and a row with `cat_id` 4 is missing from the `colors` table.
```

<div style="display: flex">
  <div style="margin-right: 2em">
    <header style="text-align:center"><strong>names</strong></header>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>cat_id</th>
          <th>name</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>Apricot</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Boots</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>Cally</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>Eugene</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div>
    <header style="text-align:center"><strong>colors</strong></header>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>cat_id</th>
          <th>color</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>orange</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>black</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>calico</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>white</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

To compute the color of the cat named Apricot, we have to use information in both tables. We can *join* the tables on the `cat_id` column, creating a new table with both `name` and `color`.

### Joins

A join combines tables by matching values in their columns.

There are four main types of joins: inner joins, outer joins, left joins, and right joins. Although all four combine tables, each one treats non-matching values differently.

### Inner Join

<b>Definition:</b> In an inner join, the final table only contains rows that have matching columns in **both** tables.



![Inner Join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_innerjoin.gif)


<b>Example:</b> We would like to join the `names` and `colors` tables together to match each cat with its color. Since both tables contain a `cat_id` column that is the unique identifier for a cat, we can use an inner join on the `cat_id` column.

<b>SQL:</b> To write an inner join in SQL we modify our `FROM` clause to use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM <TABLE_1>
    INNER JOIN <TABLE_2>
    ON <...>
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM names AS N
    INNER JOIN colors AS C
    ON N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>cat_id</th>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>cat_id</th>
      <th>color</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Apricot</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>orange</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Boots</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>black</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Cally</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>calico</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You may verify that each cat name is matched with its color. Notice that the cats with `cat_id` 3 and 4 are not present in our resulting table because the `colors` table doesn't have a row with `cat_id` 4 and the `names` table doesn't have a row with `cat_id` 3. In an inner join, if a row doesn't have a matching value in the other table, the row is not included in the final result.

Assuming we have a DataFrame called `names` and a DataFrame called `colors`, we can conduct an inner join in `pandas` by writing:

```python
pd.merge(names, colors, how='inner', on='cat_id')
```

### Full/Outer Join

<b>Definition:</b> In a full join (sometimes called an outer join), **all records from both tables** are included in the joined table. If a row doesn't have a match in the other table, the missing values are filled in with `NULL`.

![Full outer join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_fulljoin.gif)

<b>Example:</b> As before, we join the `names` and `colors` tables together to match each cat with its color. This time, we want to keep all rows in either table even if there isn't a match.

<b>SQL:</b> To write an outer join in SQL we modify our `FROM` clause to use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM <TABLE_1>
    FULL JOIN <TABLE_2>
    ON <...>
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT name, color
FROM names N
    FULL JOIN colors C
    ON N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

| cat_id        | name          | color    |
| ------------- |---------------|-----------
| 0             | Apricot       | orange   |
| 1             | Boots         | black    |
| 2             | Cally         | calico   |
| 3             | NULL          | white    |
| 4             | Eugene        | NULL     |

````{note}
Notice that the final output contains the entries with `cat_id` 3 and 4. If a row does not have a match, it is still included in the final output and any missing values are filled in with `NULL`.

In `pandas`:

```
pd.merge(names, colors, how='outer', on='cat_id')
```
````

### Left Join

<b>Definition:</b> In a left join, all records from the **left table** are included in the joined table. If a row doesn't have a match in the right table, the missing values are filled in with `NULL`.

![left join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_leftjoin.gif)

<b>Example:</b> As before, we join the `names` and `colors` tables together to match each cat with its color. This time, we want to keep all the cat names even if a cat doesn't have a matching color.

<b>SQL:</b> To write an left join in SQL we modify our `FROM` clause to use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM <TABLE_1>
    LEFT JOIN <TABLE_2>
    ON <...>
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT name, color
FROM names N
    LEFT JOIN colors C
    ON N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

| cat_id        | name          | color    |
| ------------- |---------------|-----------
| 0             | Apricot       | orange   |
| 1             | Boots         | black    |
| 2             | Cally         | calico   |
| 4             | Eugene        | NULL     |

````{note}
Notice that the final output includes all four cat names. Three of the `cat_id`s in the `names` relation had matching `cat_id`s in the `colors` table and one did not (Eugene). The cat name that did not have a matching color has `NULL` as its color.

In `pandas`:

```
pd.merge(names, colors, how='left', on='cat_id')
```
````

### Right Join

<b>Definition:</b> In a right join, all records from the **right table** are included in the joined table. If a row doesn't have a match in the left table, the missing values are filled in with `NULL`.

![right join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_rightjoin.gif)

<b>Example:</b> As before, we join the `names` and `colors` tables together to match each cat with its color. This time, we want to keep all the cat color even if a cat doesn't have a matching name.

<b>SQL:</b> To write a right join in SQL we modify our `FROM` clause to use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM <TABLE_1>
    RIGHT JOIN <TABLE_2>
    ON <...>
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT name, color
FROM names N
    RIGHT JOIN colors C
    ON N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

| cat_id        | name          | color    |
| ------------- |---------------|-----------
| 0             | Apricot       | orange   |
| 1             | Boots         | black    |
| 2             | Cally         | calico   |
| 3             | NULL          | white    |

This time, observe that the final output includes all four cat colors. Three of the `cat_id`s in the `colors` relation had matching `cat_id`s in the `names` table and one did not (white). The cat color that did not have a matching name has `NULL` as its name.

You may also notice that a right join produces the same result a left join with the table order swapped. That is, `names` left joined with `colors` is the same as `colors` right joined with `names`. Because of this, some SQL engines (such as SQLite) do not support right joins.

In `pandas`:

```
pd.merge(names, colors, how='right', on='cat_id')
```

### Implicit Inner Joins

There are typically multiple ways to accomplish the same task in SQL just as there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task in Python. We point out one other method for writing an inner join that appears in practice called an *implicit join*. Recall that we previously wrote the following to conduct an inner join:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM names AS N
    INNER JOIN colors AS C
    ON N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

An implicit inner join has a slightly different syntax. Notice in particular that the `FROM` clause uses a comma to select from two tables and that the query includes a `WHERE` clause to specify the join condition.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM names AS N, colors AS C
WHERE N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

When multiple tables are specified in the `FROM` clause, SQL creates a table containing every combination of rows from each table. For example:

sql_expr = """
SELECT *
FROM names N, colors C
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

This operation is often called a *Cartesian product*: each row in the first table is paired with every row in the second table. Notice that many rows contain cat colors that are not matched properly with their names. The additional `WHERE`  clause in the implicit join filters out rows that do not have matching `cat_id` values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM names AS N, colors AS C
WHERE N.cat_id = C.cat_id;
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>cat_id</th>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>cat_id</th>
      <th>color</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Apricot</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>orange</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Boots</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>black</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Cally</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>calico</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Joining Multiple Tables

To join multiple tables, extend the `FROM` clause with additional `JOIN` operators. For example, the following table `ages` includes data about each cat's age.

| cat_id        | age     | 
| ------------- |---------|
| 0             | 4       | 
| 1             | 3       | 
| 2             | 9       | 
| 4             | 20      | 

To conduct an inner join on the `names`, `colors`, and `ages` table, we write:

# Joining three tables

sql_expr = """
SELECT name, color, age
    FROM names n
    INNER JOIN colors c ON n.cat_id = c.cat_id
    INNER JOIN ages a ON n.cat_id = a.cat_id;
"""
pd.read_sql(sql_expr, sqlite_engine)

## Summary
<hr>

We have introduced SQL syntax and the most important SQL statements needed to conduct data analysis using a relational database management system.

We have covered the four main types of SQL joins: inner, full, left, and right joins. We use all four joins to combine information in separate relations, and each join differs only in how it handles non-matching rows in the input tables.
