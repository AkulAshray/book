# To the Reader

```{note}
This book is currently undergoing major updates to match current iterations of
DSI. Thanks for your patience as we rearrange and fill in missing content.
In approaching this book I am torn between different styles, which means the 
structure of the book would change on a regular basis until we find a structure that
is readable and a useful reference without too much narrative.
We have not removed content from the book entirely. Instead, we have moved
content and marked sections as \[under development\] to denote new content that is
actively being worked on.
