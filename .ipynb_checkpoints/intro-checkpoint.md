This website is for coaches, with the intended purpose of allowing coaches and associates to learn and work on upskilling their technical skills during independent learning time. You can also search this website if you are only interested to look at specific topic.

- **Installation of differnt softwares** (covering how to deal with technical issues)
- **Programming in Python**
- **Working with relational Databases**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Statistics and Probabilities**
- **Machine Learning**
